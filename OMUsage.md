# Introduction #

**OpenMalaria** is a simulator designed to model the cost and effectiveness of interventions against the _plasmodium falciparum_ malaria parasite. These simulations can be run on both a [large](http://malariacontrol.net/) and small (PC) scale.

Documented here:

  * [Installing](SetupOverview.md) **OpenMalaria** and using it to run some example scenarios
  * How to [design and configure](ScenarioDesign.md) experimental scenarios
  * Some guidance on how simulator results might be analyzed
